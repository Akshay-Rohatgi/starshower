starshower is a collection of red team tools that I've developed for personal use.

**Dyson Creds:** Similar to a Dyson Sphere that harvests energy from remote stars, dyson-creds harvests credentials from remote systems through credential harvesters placed via SSH connections. To be used at the very beginning of a red team engagement.

**mimicord:** Simple script that installs a service to run mimipenguin to extract passwords from process dumps and then post results to a Discord webhook. (need to redo it, its kind of messy right now)
